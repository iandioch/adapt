# What is this?

Irish has no words for "yes" or "no". When asked `Are you X?`, you would reply `(I) am` or `(I) am not`. In this directory is a tool that, when given a question, creates a report as to the verb form that should be used when responding.

# Setup

## Dependencies

The following tools must be set up before this module can be used:

- [Elaine UÃ­ Dhonnchadha's part of speech tagger for Irish](https://github.com/uidhonne).
- [Maltparser](http://www.maltparser.org/), and trained with [the Irish treebank](https://github.com/tlynn747/IrishDependencyTreebank/blob/master/1020-gold_master_IrishTreebank.conll).

## Config

You must set the paths to the above resources in the variables at the top of the `process.py` file.

# Usage

Run `python3 process.py`. The program will wait for questions to be fed by `stdin`, and will output its report to `stdout`.

## Input

Enter one question in Irish per line over stdin.

As an example of inputs, see the file `test_questions.txt` in this directory.

## Output

The program will output one JSON document after each input line, with a report of the structure of the question. All results will have the following fields:

```js
{
    "type": "TYPE",
    "error": null
}
```

If any error occurred during the processing of the question, the `error` field will not be null, but will contain a string describing the error. `TYPE` will be one of the following:

- `copula`
- `verb`

Depending on what kind of question it was, the rest of the JSON document will contain different data describing the structure of it. The best way to understand the structure is to run the command `cat test_questions.txt | python3 process.py` and inspect the results.
